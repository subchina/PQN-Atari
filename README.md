# PQN-Atari

## Overview
This repository includes the implementation of transfer learning experiments in reinforcement learning using the Parallelized Q-Networks (PQN) algotihm in the Atari environment. The aim of the experiment is to evaluate the effect of transfer learning on the learning curve of PQN, when performing a transfer between Atari environments, compared to the baseline.
